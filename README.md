# Orange-Fruit-Recognition-Using-Image-Segmentation
For the recognition of orange fruit, used edge detection and color detection method. And for this methodology I used image segmentation. Input images are of the oranges which were captured at different lighting condition and used image segmentation to detect color of the image. Implementation done in Python. In this system user will input image of orange. Model will convert the image from RGB to grayscale image for further processing.
